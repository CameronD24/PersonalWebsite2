# PersonalSite

<!-- This is my first personal website I completed this project by studying W3schools as well as webdocs. During my time completing this project i also used Gustavo's site as inspiration. I used flex a lot during this project as well as some other css tools. I also attempted using Js for changing the cursor... that didn't work. -->
