    <h3>Boxing</h3>
    <div class="content-container">
      <div class="text">
    <p>In the moments when I'm not immersed in coding, I passionately dedicate my time to honing my skills in boxing. Since my sophomore year in high school, I have been meticulously refining my craft at the distinguished "C4 Boxing" gym. The camaraderie and dedication that permeated the atmosphere captivated me from the moment I stepped through their doors.

      I am deeply inspired by my grandfather's illustrious boxing career. He achieved significant accolades on the global stage, with a particular prominence in Europe. His legacy in the sport was my initial beacon, guiding me towards the boxing world. Under his expert tutelage, I rapidly advanced, culminating in my selection for the USA boxing team.
      
      I had aspirations of participating in the 2024 Olympics; however, the unforeseen challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic altered that trajectory. Consequently, I've channeled my energies into my professional endeavors. Yet, the ring still calls to me, and I remain resolute in my determination to one day resume my journey in boxing.</p>

      <h3>Comedy</h3>
      <div class="content-container">
        <div class="text">
      <p>My profound appreciation for comedy runs deep. Among the various comedic forms, stand-up resonates with me the most. Whether there's a live performance in close proximity or a comedic snippet surfaces on my digital feed, I invariably find myself drawn to it. Comedy occupies a cherished space in my heart, a sanctuary from a challenging childhood. I often sought solace in vintage stand-up routines and timeless comedic sketches.

        I firmly believe that comedy holds a unique and transformative power. Amidst life's vicissitudes, it's laughter that offers us a fleeting, yet poignant respite. In that ephemeral moment of joy, our burdens lighten, our spirits uplifted, often accompanied by tears of mirth. And what truly distinguishes comedy is its universality; irrespective of one's appearance or beliefs, it provides an inclusive haven where love is disseminated through shared laughter.</p>

        <h3>Nature</h3>
        <div class="content-container">
          <div class="text">
        <p>
          Nature captivates me as profoundly as coding does. Our planet is a mosaic of breathtaking landscapes complemented by the symphony of its ambient sounds. My passion for travel has led me to explore nearly every island in the Caribbean and several cities in Mexico. My aspiration is to traverse as many countries as possible, immersing myself in the diverse tapestry of cultures, forging new connections, and seeking unparalleled experiences.
          
          When journeying abroad, I consciously veer away from the typical tourist trails, seeking instead the authentic heart of each destinationâ€”the local communities. Engaging with inhabitants, I've realized that despite the stark differences in lifestyles and backgrounds, a universal sentiment of love and camaraderie is often present. This shared human experience motivates me to continue my exploration, cherishing the countless unique individuals that enrich our world.</p>
